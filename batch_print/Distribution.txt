Absolutely! You can distribute your Python app as a standalone macOS application (an .app bundle) so that you (or others) don’t need to install Python or any dependencies manually.

### The Best Solution: PyInstaller or Py2app

#### 1. **PyInstaller** (Recommended for cross-platform, including macOS)
- Packages your Python script and all dependencies into a single executable or .app bundle.
- Users can just double-click the app—no Python or pip needed.

#### 2. **py2app** (macOS-specific)
- Similar to PyInstaller, but only for macOS.

## How to Package with PyInstaller

1. **Install PyInstaller:**
   ```sh
   pip3 install pyinstaller
   ```

2. **Package your app:**
   ```sh
   pyinstaller --windowed --onefile --name "BatchPrintTool" batch_print_gui.py
   ```
   - `--windowed` prevents a terminal window from opening with the GUI.
   - `--onefile` creates a single executable (slower to start, but easier to distribute).
   - The output will be in the `dist` folder.

3. **(Optional) Create a macOS .app bundle:**
   ```sh
   pyinstaller --windowed --name "BatchPrintTool" batch_print_gui.py
   ```
   - This will create a `.app` bundle in `dist/BatchPrintTool.app`.

4. **Distribute the `dist/BatchPrintTool` (or `.app`) to other Macs.**
   - Users can just double-click to run.

## Notes & Tips

- **First launch may be slow** (especially with `--onefile`).
- **CUPS and system printers** must still be set up on the target Mac (but this is standard for all printing apps).
- **If you use images or other resources**, you may need to adjust your code to use relative paths or include them in the bundle.
- **Apple Gatekeeper**: On first launch, macOS may warn that the app is from an unidentified developer. You can right-click > Open to bypass this, or sign the app if distributing widely.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- LibreOffice (for Office file conversion)
  - Download: https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/
  - Or install via Homebrew: brew install --cask libreoffice

---

## 1. **Why Not Bundle LibreOffice Directly?**
- LibreOffice is a large, complex application (hundreds of MBs).
- It is not designed to be embedded or bundled inside Python apps.
- Licensing: LibreOffice is open source (MPL/LGPL), but you must comply with its license if you redistribute it.

---

## 2. **Best Practices for Distributing Your App**

### **A. Recommend/Require Users to Install LibreOffice**
- **Simplest and most common approach.**
- In your README and installer, clearly state:  
  “This app requires LibreOffice to be installed for batch printing of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files.”
- Provide a download link: https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/
- Optionally, check for `soffice` on first run and show a helpful message if not found.

### **B. Automate Installation (Optional)**
- For advanced users, you can provide a script that:
  - Detects if `soffice` is installed.
  - If not, downloads and installs LibreOffice automatically (using Homebrew or direct download).
- Example (for Homebrew users):
  ```sh
  brew install --cask libreoffice
  ```

### **C. (Advanced) Bundle LibreOffice in Your Installer**
- You could, in theory, package LibreOffice with your app and set your tool to use the bundled `soffice` binary.
- This is complex, increases your app size, and may have licensing/distribution implications.
- Not recommended unless you are distributing to a controlled environment and can handle updates/security.

## 3. **How to Integrate with Your App**

- In your Python code, check for `soffice` at startup:
  ```python
  import shutil
  if not shutil.which('soffice'):
      # Show a message to the user
      print("LibreOffice (soffice) is required. Please install it from https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/")
  ```
- In your GUI, you can show a dialog if `soffice` is missing, with a download link.

---

## 4. **Document in Your README**
Add a section like:
```
## Requirements

- Python 3
- LibreOffice (for Office file conversion)
  - Download: https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/
  - Or install via Homebrew: brew install --cask libreoffice
```

---

## 5. **If You Package as a .app (PyInstaller/py2app)**
- You still need to instruct users to install LibreOffice separately.
- You can include a first-run check and a helpful message if it’s missing.

### **Summary Table**

| Approach                | Pros                        | Cons                        |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Require user install    | Simple, small app           | User must install manually  |
| Automate install script | User-friendly, less manual  | More complex, platform-specific |
| Bundle LibreOffice      | All-in-one, no user action  | Huge size, licensing, complex |

---

**Recommendation:**  
Require users to install LibreOffice, and check for it in your app with a clear message if missing. This is the most robust and user-friendly approach for most distributions.

If you want, I can add a “LibreOffice check” to your app and update your README accordingly. Let me know!
